    "## Conceptual description\n",
    "The basic idea of Schelling's seggregation model is quite straight forward. Imagine we have agents organized on a grid. Agents are either red or blue. Agents prefer to be in an environment with agents of the same color, but they are quite tolerant. If the fraction of neighbors of a different color is higher than this tolerance threshold, the agent moves to another free grid cell. At what level of tolerance does segregation occur? \n",
    "\n",
    "Given this basic description, the model is composed of a grid, with one agent per grid cell. This grid is not completely filled because we need to have free space to where an agent can move. Each agent has a tolerance level, and checks when asked if the fraction of neighbors that is of the different type is higher than this tolerance level. \n",

    "## Agent activation\n",
    "A key issue with the Schelling model, and a key way in which this model is different from the various versions of the Axelrod model is that a step by a given agent can change the local environment. Imagine that a given agent checks its neighborhood, decided that the number of neighbors of a different color is higher than its threshold, and thus decides to move to an empty spot. This move changes the neighborhood the agent is leaving. It also changes the neighborhood the agent is moving to. Depending on the order in which agents are activated (i.e. the `step` method is called) different dynamic patterns can occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various archetypical agent activation patterns. In the axelrod model, we simply activated all agents in the same order because activation order did not matter in any of the versions of the model. However, in for example the Schelling model, we can't do this because activation order will matter. A standard solution for this is to use **random activation**. That is, we shuffle the agents every model step and activate them in this shuffeled order. In Mesa, this is readily available via `model.agents.shuffle_do` which is a convenient short-hand for `model.agents.shuffle().do()`. An other common option is to seperate the intentions of the agents from their implementation. This is sometimes also called **staged activation**. The idea is that first all agents based on their local information decide what action they are going to take without updating any of their public attributes. Next, all agents implement their action and thus update their public attributes. In Mesa, this is done by having two methods on the agent (e.g., `determine_action`, `implement_action`). Next, we can easily implement staged activation by doing `model.agents.do(\"determine_action\").do(\"implement_action\")`. Note that I am assuming here that there is no path dependence in either `determine_action` or `implement_action` because if there was, we would have to use `shuffle_do`. Staged activation can be used for simulating true parallel actions, but it can also be used for more complex interaction patterns were agents have multiple methods that contain part of their overal activation. A last commonly encountered pattern is where we have multiple different classes of agents, and we want to activate all agents of a given class. This is sometimes also called **random activation by type**. Again this is easy to do in mesa:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "agent_types = self.random.shuffle(Agent.__subclasses__)\n",
    "for agent_type in agent_types:\n",
    "    self.agent_by_type[agent_type].shuffle_do('step')\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we have 2 levels of randomness. First, we shuffle the order of the agent types (using the `Agent.__subclasses__` trick we saw with Axelrod, but you could also explicate the types here: `self.random.shuffle([Wolf, Sheep, Grass])`). Next for each class of agents, we get the associated `AgentSet` and use `shuffle_do` for random activation. \n",

    "So far, we have run the model for the default values of the parameters `density`, `minority_fraction`, and `tolerance_threshold`. It is quite common in Agent Based Modelling to perform a parameter sweep where one runs the model over a range of parameterizations and analyse the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "MESA support this with a `batch_run` function. See the [MESA tutorial](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/intro_tutorial.html#batch-run) for details. In short, the `batch_run` function allows you to specify a set of values (fixed for parameters you don't want to vary and iterables for the parameters you do want to vary), the number of iterations/replications for each run and the number of steps to run the model for. At the end of each run, it automatically collects all statistics specified in the `self.datacollector` attribute of your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `batch_run` function assumes that a `self.running` attribute is available on the model. This is used to indicate that the model has reached a stable equilibrium and will not change in any subsequent steps. If running is True, the model will still change. If running is False, the model has reached an equilibrium.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Let's update our model with this running attribute. What conditions must hold for the model to have reached equilibirum?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer: The condition that must hold for the model to have reached equilibirum, is that all agents in the model are happy.**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Implement this condition and the running attribute. \n",
    "*Hint:* you can get the number of agents in the model via `len(self.agents)`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Perform a batch run with the following settings. Visualize some results:\n",
    "    * height and width fixed at 20\n",
    "    * density varies from 0.8 to 0.9 with 0.025 increments\n",
