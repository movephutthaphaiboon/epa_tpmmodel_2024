    "# Model description\n",
    "Below, a mesa implementation is given of Eppstein's Civil Violence model 1. The basic idea of this model is the following. We have 2 types of agents: cops and citizens. Cops and Citizens both have a field of vision and they move every step to a random empty location within their field of vision. The agents are all located on a toroidal grid and each grid cell can only be occupied by at most a single agent. \n",
    "\n",
    "*note: This assignment is adapted from previous exams. A typical exam would combine assignment 1 or 2 (i.e., implementing something within the model), with 3 or 4 (i.e., doing some experimentation with the model)*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Citizen\n",
    "Citizens can protest (i.e. becomes $active$). They decide every tick, after having moved, whether or not they want to protest (i.e., become active). They make this decision based on their attributes. \n",
    "\n",
    "- attributes with unique values for each citizen:\n",
    "    - hardship, drawn from $U(0, 1)$\n",
    "    - risk aversion, drawn from $U(0, 1)$\n",
    "- attributes with shared values across all Citizens (i.e., class level attributes):\n",
    "    - perception of the legitimacy of the State, a user specified parameter between 0 and 1. \n",
    "    - threshold above which Citizens will protest, a user specified parameter usually set to a small positive value (e.g., 0.1).\n",
    "\n",
    "An agent becomes active if: (Grievance - Net Risk) > Threshold. Otherwise the agent is $quiet$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Grievance** is calculated for each citizen as: \n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "    grievance = hardship * (1-legitimacy)\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "The **net risk** is the perceived chance of being arrested times the personal level of risk aversion. The perceived chance of being arrested is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "    p = 1 - e^{(-1*k*round(c/a))}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $k$ is an arrenst probability constant (set to 2.3 as default), \n",
    "- $c$ is the number of cops within the field of vision,\n",
    "- $a$ is the number of active citizens within the field of vision including the agent itself (who considers herself always active).\n",
    "\n",
    "So the net risk is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "net\\_risk = p * risk\\_aversion\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cop\n",
    "After having moved, the cop checks his field of vision for any active citizens. It then arrests a randomly selected active citizen within its field of vision. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Arrest\n",
    "If a citizen is arrested, it cannot move. Upon arrest, a citizen also receives a random jail time, which is the number of ticks for which it remains under arrest. Jail time is drawn from $U(U, J_{max})$, where $J_{max}$ is a user specified parameter which can substantially alter the dynamics of the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Implementation details.\n",
    "The model below is an implementation of the civil violence model. Given that the movement behavior and the way in which agents update their field of vision is the same for both Citizens and Cops, this functionality is implemented in a BaseAgent class. The Cop class and Citizen class both extend this BaseAgent class and add their respective behavior to it. The model itself uses a von Neumann toroidol space with maximum 1 agent per grid cell. Class level attributes are used for legitimacy, vision, $k$, and activation threshold. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Assignment 1\n",
    "Given the description above and the provided implementation below, complete the model `__init__` function. The expected results are shown in the figure and you can use the provided plotting code to generate your results.\n",

We can use the model to investigate whether this might have made a difference. How does the behaviour of the model change if we move from 2% cops to 4% or 6% cops?
